<H2>1. Akai disk format overview</H2>Akai floppy disks are formatted as =
2 sides=20
of 80 tracks with 5 or 10 sectors per track. Each sector is 1024 bytes =
long,=20
giving a total of 800k (low density) or 1600k (high density). PCs use 9 =
or 18=20
sectors of 512 bytes and will not read Akai floppies without =
reprogramming. As=20
far as I can tell, Mac floppy drives can't read Akai floppy disks at =
all.=20
<P>Unwritten bytes on a disk are set to zero. Multi-byte values have the =
lsb=20
first (little-endian). This document refers to the first byte in a block =
as=20
'byte 1', not 'byte 0'. All values are decimal unless otherwise stated.=20
<P>Akai hard disks and CD-ROMs use the same file format as Akai floppy =
disks,=20
and virtually the same disk format.=20
<P>=20
<H2>2. S900/S950 disk format</H2>Track 1, side 1 starts with 64 entries =
of 24=20
bytes as follows: <PRE><FONT color=3D#000099>   Length   Format      =

(1536 to=20
4736 for high density) contain a map of how the blocks on the disk are =
used, in=20
the form of 2-byte unsigned integers. For example, if a file starts at =
block 5,=20
map entry 5 may contain the value 6, indicating that the next block to =
read is=20
block 6. The next block to read is then given by map entry 6. The map =
entry for=20
the last block of a file contains the value 32768. Unused blocks have a =
map=20
entry of zero. The first 4 blocks are needed for the file entries and =
map.=20

disks, but=20
the S900 can only read S900 or S950 low-density disks.=20
