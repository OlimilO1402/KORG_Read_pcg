# Reading_KORG_pcg
##Reading the .pcg-fileformat for KORG synths in VB
It's just a tiny sample project, and maybe it can not read every pcg-file.
But it could serve as a starting point for your own implementations or maybe 
just in case you want to see whats inside this or that pcg-file.
Click File->Open (e.g. "Yamaha Guitar\GUITAR.PCG") or maybe just drag'n'drop 
a file from windows explorer onto TR-Reader.
TR-Reader tries to read the file, please be patient for a second or two.
In the textbox it shows some informations about the read chunks.
Now click "View->Show Samples" and you can step through the samples (.KSF) in 
the Listbox on the left (if there are any). On the right click the button 
"Wave" in menu File click "Save All wav" (please be patient) now if you click 
Play cou can audition the samples (if there are any).
